# Scripts
### short scripts I use sometimes

### PinBoardDL.py
I use Pinterest to create moodboards, or just collect stuff I find on Pinterest sometimes. Sometimes, I want to print these out, create stickers, or have printouts to reference charts I've saved. This script was created to automate a process I do on my Mac. It prompts the user for link to the Pinterest board, and it downloads all of the photos on that board (must be public) to a folder called `gallery-dl` (in the same location as my script). Because I like to make my life hard :upside_down_face:, I use iCloud to let me edit together pictures I find using Procreate on my iPad. Once the script is done downloading the pictures, it will open the folder it created and Apple's Photos app where I can drag and drop what I have downloaded and access them via iCloud on my iPad.


### GithubUL.sh
The commands I don't like to type out when creating a Github repo from an existing folder on my local machine. Skips me a couple steps forward to actually naming and setting permissions for the repo on Github using the CLI.

### Udemy Transcripts
Sometimes it's easier to process information by listening. Sometimes it's easier to read, and when reading, being able to annotate with pens/pencils/highlighters is even better. Despite the user- and accessibility-friendly options human-proofread captions on Jason Dion's videos on Udemy, the rigidity of the transcript having to be read on a time-synced and -formatted can be slow, annoying, and limit further utility such as annotation. This script takes a saved html file, parses the html to output a simple text file of the transcript. <br>
(*note: Udemy is not very developer friendly. Makes sense because the content hosted is paid. My script is simple and not very powerful, but it does help me in the right direction. Specific issues mentioned in comments in script.)
