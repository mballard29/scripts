# Scripts
### short scripts I use sometimes

### PinBoardDL.py
I use Pinterest to create moodboards, or just collect stuff I find on Pinterest sometimes. Sometimes, I want to print these out, create stickers, or have printouts to reference charts I've saved. This script was created to automate a process I do on my Mac. It prompts the user for link to the Pinterest board, and it downloads all of the photos on that board (must be public) to a folder called `gallery-dl` (in the same location as my script). Because I like to make my life hard :upside_down_face:, I use iCloud to let me edit together pictures I find using Procreate on my iPad. Once the script is done downloading the pictures, it will open the folder it created and Apple's Photos app where I can drag and drop what I have downloaded and access them via iCloud on my iPad.


### GithubUL.sh
The commands I don't like to type out when creating a Github repo from an existing folder on my local machine. Skips me a couple steps forward to actually naming and setting permissions for the repo on Github using the CLI.
